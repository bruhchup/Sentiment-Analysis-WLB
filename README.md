# Sentiment-Analysis-WLB
This is a project for my software engineering class. Myself and a group of classmates collaborated on this sentiment analysis software that graphically displays overall work/life balance of employees at a company.

To build a sentiment analysis software, we will follow these key steps:
    Collect and preprocess text data
    Convert text into numerical features
    Train a machine learning model
    Test and evaluate the model
    Deploy the model as an API

We will use the following libraries:
    Pandas – Load and process the dataset
    Scikit-learn – Train and evaluate machine learning models
    NLTK – Preprocess text (remove stopwords, tokenize)
    Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
    WordCloud – Generate word frequency insights
